# Project Title - EmeraldHandmade
A digital marketplace for handcrafted goods.

EmeraldHandmade is an online platform where creators can share their unique handmade items and enthusiasts can discover and purchase these one-of-a-kind pieces.

## Code Showcase

This project showcases my skills in Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other technologies. 

- Users can create accounts using TRPC. Upon account creation, a verification email is sent to the user's email address, powered by Nodemailer and Resend.
- The application includes a dashboard, built with Payload.
- The application features an intuitive navigation bar. Users can explore various categories, each opening into a menu with three subcategories - Best Sellers, New Arrivals, and Editor Picks, each accompanied by an image.
-  User and item data are stored and managed using MongoDB and Mongoose.
-  An Express server is set up to handle server-side operations.
